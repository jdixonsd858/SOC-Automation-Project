# SOC Automation Project 

## Objective

The Telemtry Lab project aimed to create a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and Sysmon for generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Creation and configuration of Virtual Machines.
- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- SIEM system (Splunk) and Sysmon for log ingestion and analysis.
- Malware Creation tools (such as Metasploit) for creating and executing an exploit.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
